I was at peace until you came and set a careless mind aflame.
I lived in quiet; cold, content; all longing in safe banishment until your ghostly lips and eyes made wisdom unwise.
Naught was in me to tempt your feet to seek a lodging.
Quite forgot lay the sweet solitude we two in childhood used to wander through. Time's hand had closed my heart about and shut you out.
Well, and what then? O vision grave, take all the little all I have!
Strip me of what in voiceless thought life's kept of life, unhoped, unsought! Reverie and dream that memory must hide deep in dust!
Only this I say: though cold and bare this haunted house you have chosen to share, still 'neath its walls the moonbeam goes and trembles on the untended rose.
Still o'er it's broken roof-tree rise the starry arches of the skies. And in your slightest word shall be the thunder of an ebbing sea.
