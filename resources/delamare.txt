'Who knocks?'
'I, who was beautiful, beyond all dreams to restore. I from the roots of the dark thorn am hither, And knock on the door.'
'Who speaks?'
'I -- once was my speech sweet as the bird's on the air. When echo lurks by the waters to heed; 'Tis I speak thee fair.'

'Dark is the hour!'
'Aye, and cold.'
'Lone is my house.'
'Ah, but mine?'
'Sight, touch, lips, eyes gleamed in vain.' 
'Long dead these to thine.' 

Silence. Still faint on the porch brake the flames of the stars. In gloom groped a hope-wearied hand over keys, bolts, and bars. A face peered. All the grey night
In chaos of vacancy shone; Nought but vast sorrow was there -- the sweet cheat gone.
