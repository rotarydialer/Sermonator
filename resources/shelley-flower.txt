The flower that smiles today tomorrow dies.
All that we wish to stay tempts and then flies.
What is this world's delight? Lightning that mocks the night, brief even as bright.
Virtue, how frail it is! Friendship how rare!
Love, how it sells poor bliss for proud despair!
But we, though soon they fall, survive their joy and all which ours we call.
Whilst skies are blue and bright, whilst flowers are gay,
Whilst eyes, that change ere night make glad the day;
Whilst yet the calm hours creep, dream thou-- and from thy sleep then wake to weep.
